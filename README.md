# Self-Care Center 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
- The purpose of the application is to provide self-care messaging using arrays of mantras and affirmations. 

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
- Open command line.
- Select from the parent directory you want to be in using cd.
- `git clone git@github.com:vsriqui/self-care-center.git`
- Alternatively, the github deployed site is [here](https://vsriqui.github.io/self-care-center/).

### Preview of App:

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
I am currently 3 weeks into the turing.edu program, I would say this small project took me 10-15 hours if I'm including the research along with it.

### Contributors:
[//]: <> (Who worked on this application? Link to their GitHubs.)
- [Victor Sriqui's Github](https://github.com/vsriqui).

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
- The learning goals in my belief were learning how to write css, html, and have javascript interacting with all of it.
- I used terminal, vscode, chrome console, and an e-art tool to figure out how to make a smooth graadient for CSS.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
- Learning how to use radio buttons was a bit confusing at first, but makes logical sense once you figure it out.
- Figuring out how to make elements disappear and reappear from the same page while managing the spacing. Our last project really just acted on the hidden attribute, but I wanted a more seamless transition between login page and Self-Care page.
